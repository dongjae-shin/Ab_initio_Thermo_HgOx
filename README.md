# Introduction
The codes here are python codes (Jupyter Notebook) to visualize the stabilities of several SCR catalysts with different VO<sub>x</sub> structures. The stability, or the Gibbs free energy of formation (&Delta;*G*<sup>form</sup>), which was calculated by density functional theory (DFT), is plotted in the form of three-dimensional phase diagram (contour plot). The stability was plotted with respect to temperature (*T*) and partial pressures (*p*<sub>i</sub>) of gases.

The image above shows that which structure among the considered four models (*tetra*, *tetra-h*, *octa*, and *octa-h*) is thermodynamically the most favorable at a particular set of *T* and *p*<sub>i</sub>. The scientific details of this code can be found in the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.149462).
